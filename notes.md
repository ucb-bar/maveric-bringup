## Strategy

### FPGA Devboard

- Things to consider: cost, FPGA type, host interface, DRAM, connector + voltages, form factor
- [Xilinx VCU118](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vcu118.html)
  - $9k
  - Virtex Ultrascale+
  - USB-UART / PCIe with riser
  - 2x 2.5 Gib DDR4
  - FMC-HPC (ASP-134486-01), VADJ = 1.8V by default, can go down to 1.2V if FMC EEPROM is programmed or if system controller is overridden (intricate, but doable)
  - Large PCIe card
- [Opal Kelly XEM7350](https://opalkelly.com/products/xem7350/)
  - $1.5k
  - Kintex 7
  - USB3 with special RTL + drivers (Opal Kelly FrontPanel) with 340 MiB/s bandwidth
  - 512 MiB DDR3
  - FMC-HPC (-K160T part) (ASP-134486-01) (mates with ASP-134488-01), (34 (LA, Vadj) + 24 (HA, Vadj) + 22 (HB, Vio) = 80 IO pins), Vadj easy to set to 1.2V permanently, Vio comes from FMC_VIO_B_M2C (which can just be shorted to Vadj on the mezzanine)
  - Pretty small card
- [Digilent Nexys Video](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/)
  - $550
  - Artix 7
  - USB-UART / Ethernet / FT2232 (FTDI USB-FIFO chip, kind of an old part with iffy drivers)
  - 512 MiB DDR3
  - FMC-LPC (ASP-134603-01), 34x2 pins, Vadj set to 1.2V by default, easy

#### Mechanical Sketch

- https://docs.opalkelly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/XEM7350-MechanicalDrawing.pdf
  - 4x standoffs for the FPGA devboard that exceed 6.5mm in height, 2.70mm hole diameter (use M2 standoff kit, M2 has clearance hole diameter of 2.6mm)
  - 2x standoffs for the chip motherboard that are likely around 18.5mm (will use same hole diameter)

### Chip Signals + Debug

[Bump map](https://bwrcrepo.eecs.berkeley.edu/kimsea8209/rtml-intech22-chipyard/-/blob/rtml-jerry/vlsi/specs/rtml-bumps.yml?ref_type=heads) is saved in the `bumpmap` folder. I still have some questions.

#### Signals

- **JTAG**
  - Directly place the JTAG header on the motherboard. Don't daisy chain chip JTAG to FMC JTAG. Don't pass JTAG signals through FMC.
  - Use [this JTAG debugger](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-OCD-HL/) (**-HL variant** works down to 0.65V)
    - [Digikey link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/olimex-ltd/ARM-USB-OCD-HL/21662466) ($58.79)
  - Use a USB optoisolator if we're scared
    - [Olimex link](https://www.olimex.com/Products/USB-Modules/USB-ISO/)
  - Standard [20-pin ARM JTAG header](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101416/0100/Hardware-Description/Target-Interfaces/ARM-Standard-JTAG)
    - 2 rows Ã— 10 pins at 0.1" step
    - [This will do, Digikey link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/SBH11-PBPC-D10-ST-BK/1990065)
    - [Another Molex alternative that's much more expensive for some reason](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0702462002/760185)
- **DDR DFI**
  - Input pins to the chip should be grounded and output pins should be left floating
  - Not going to expose this interface on this board, it's not worth it
- **UART**
  1. Wire through FMC if we want to use the FPGA to drive chip UART
  2. Break out to headers for [FTDI USB-UART cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9718)
    - Break out into headers that directly plug into the cable socket
    - Requires level translation from 1.2V to 3.3/5V
  - Jumpers to select between the 1) and 2) options for interacting with the chip via UART
    - Use standard 0.1" pitch 3x1 male headers and a shorting jumper for each wire (RX/TX)
    - [Shorting jumper - Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/QPC02SXGN-RC/2618262)
- **Serial TL**
  - Break out every signal (4 data + 1 valid = 5 pins/direction, 10+1 clock) to header pins via 0 Ohm resistor
  - Length match all signals roughly, within ~5-10 mm
  - Make sure all signals land in same FPGA IO bank and land on pins with roughly the same [routing length on the devboard](https://pins.opalkelly.com/pin_list/XEM7350)
- **Chip reset**
  - **TODO**: Check if reset is active low or high. I suspect active high as usual.
  - Breakout reset to header pin
  - Drive a LED to indicate reset state with driver FET (make sure V_{gs,max} << 1.2V)

#### Clocking

- Serial TL clock: always driven from FPGA FMC along with rest of serial TL signals
- Core clock + PLL refclk
  - Check termination (?), I think both should be regular high-impedance CMOS
  - FMC pins from FPGA drive SMA female port
  - Another SMA female port drives the chip
  - Short SMA bridge cable can be used for FPGA clock driving, otherwise use bench clock generator
  - Controlled impedance and 50 Ohm termination is unnecessary - we are driving high-Z inputs anyways so max frequency will be quite low

#### Power

- Chip has 2 power inputs (VDD = core, VDDH = IO)
- VDDH driven by Vadj
  - There should be a VDDH moat we can flood on the power plane
- VDD driven by banana plug input from bench supply
  - There will be a core VDD area under the socket we can flood
- GND is shared among everything, also driven by banana plug input
  - Short all grounds together, uniform flood plane
- FMC provides 3.3V, 5V, and 12V supplies, which we won't use for anything except driving LEDs
- **TODO**: check if there is any issue with driving the IO and core with different supplies
  - Perhaps provide mode to short VDD with Vadj (but this is risky - we lose current limiter)
- Headers for Vadj, VDD, GND, all FMC provided supplies

### Decap

- Same strategy as hyperscale chip
- 10uF caps, 0603, place on backside of socket. Be wary of backside KOZ which are quite unusual.

### Chip Board to FPGA Connector

- Just use FMC, don't bother with adding the FMC EEPROM, loop FMC I2C and JTAG on the board with no daisy chaining
  - [FMC FAQ](https://www.vita.com/FMC-FAQ)
    - Attaching a LPC mezzanine to a HPC carrier is just fine as long as none of the HPC pins are used on the mezzanine (this is likely doable for us)
  - [Samtec's VITA 57.1 part picker](https://www.samtec.com/standards/vita/fmc/)
    - We can choose any HPC/LPC connector with/without leaded solder depending on what connectors are [in stock at JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/parts/all-electronic-components)
- FMC powergood (C2M)
  - Add LED with driver FET
  - Add header probe

## PCB CAD

### Considerations

- [Hyperscale test plan slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U_Xe0r3WAxrghMTiEDUyeD21PqD4RekB/edit#slide=id.g2c498c81fbe_0_5S)
  - Contains some clocking and PLL and reset notes
- Plan is to use JLCPCB with 6+ layer 2mm board, 2U" ENIG, epoxy filled vias (if via-in-pad is required), 0.15mm min vias, uncontrolled impedance
  - Ideally I can relax the min via diameter, but it may not be possible with the fine BGA pitch. Via-in-pad might be necessary to make routing doable with few layers. Increase layers if required: maybe we can get away with 4 even.
  - Plan is to also do assembly with JLCPCB and get just fully assembled boards. Might need to special order FMC terminals, but otherwise OK
- [JLCPCB PCB Design Rules](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-capabilities)
  - min 0.25mm BGA pads - OK
  - hole to hole clearance 0.5mm - OK
  - 0.09mm min trace width, 0.09 min trace spacing - seems sufficient for BGA escape
  - Everything looks good enough, no need for fancy board house
- [JLCPCB BGA Design Notes](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/243-BGA-Design-Guidelines---PCB-Layout-Recommendations-for-BGA-packages)
  - 0.10mm min trace to BGA pad spacing
  - Everything still seems good enough
- [JLCPCB via-in-pad notes](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/122-Via-Covering:-Tented,-Untented,-Plugged,-Epoxy-Filled-and-Copper-epoxy-filled)
  - 6+ layer boards come with epoxy filled vias for free! Pricing is insanely cheap for via-in-pad. Vias must be smaller than 0.5mm for full coverage.
- Someone has drafted [KiCad DRC rules for JLCPCB](https://gist.github.com/darkxst/f713268e5469645425eed40115fb8b49?permalink_comment_id=4818217) which I can use for reference
- Someone has tried to [escape a 0.5mm pitch BGA](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/altium/altium-jlcpcb-and-0-65mm-bga/) and it seems fine - just need to relax some design rules and make sure the hole clearance rule is specified correctly
- Another [via-in-pad attempt for 0.5mm pitch BGA](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/676149/how-to-escape-0-5mm-ball-grid-array-pins) - seems possible with via-in-pad

### Stackup

- [JLCPCB Stackups](https://jlcpcb.com/impedance)
- [JLCPCB Controlled Impedance Calculator](https://jlcpcb.com/pcb-impedance-calculator)
  - Just match the stackup in the previous link with the one here and it will give you a trace width for a single-ended non-coplanar trace (for the PLL refclk)

### Design Notes

#### UNI2 Socket

- Unit A-D: HSDIFF_{1-18}_{Q1-4}
- Unit E-H: IODIFF_{1-41}_{Q1-4}
- Unit I/J: Q1_{VDD, VDDV/VDDH}
- Unit K/L: Q2_{VDD, VDDV/VDDH}
- Unit M/N: Q3_{VDD, VDDV/VDDH}
- Unit O/P: Q4_{VDD, VDDV/VDDH}
- Unit Q-Y: VSS

#### FMC Terminal Selection

Possible parts [we can choose from](https://www.samtec.com/standards/vita/fmc/).
I would avoid tin-lead parts just because JLCPCB uses non-leaded solderpaste, and I'm unsure if reflow will work properly.
Also noting stock from JLCPCB.

- 8.5mm, lead-free, HPC: ASP-134602-01
  - 0 stock, $24.63 / part
- 8.5mm, lead-free, LPC: ASP-134606-01
  - 0 stock, $22.24 / part
- 10mm, lead-free, HPC: ASP-134488-01
  - 0 stock, listed as unavailable
- 10mm, lead-free, LPC: ASP-134604-01
  - 9 stock, $15.30 / part, still requires pre-order

- C2M = FPGA to motherboard = connector outputs
- M2C = motherboard to FPGA = connector inputs

#### FMC Pin to Socket Pin Mapping

- Use [XEM7350 Pins](https://pins.opalkelly.com/pin_list/XEM7350#) as reference for length matching. Keep all pins on the same FPGA IO bank ideally. We can choose from IO banks 15 or 16. We should keep to trace lengths (FMC socket to FPGA) around 80mm (78-82mm).

#### Questions

- What is the deal with clocking? The FPGA will drive a LVCMOS12 IO standard, so the output impedance should be quite low. And we're driving into a high Z load on the chip side. Can we just elide termination even on the SMA jumpers?

## Tasks

- [x] Check FMC connector footprint [d:6/10]
  - [x] Dimension check: All dimensions check out, I drew some additional things on the silkscreen
  - [x] Solderpaste check: Specifically check solderpaste layer expansion. Pad 25 mils, soldermask expansion 4 mils (default, not that critical), solder paste 35 mils! So yes I adjusted the solder paste clearance.
- [x] Add FMC LPC symbol [d:6/10]
- [ ] Wire FMC connector on schematic [d:6/10]
  - Connect power supplies
  - Connect various things to GND / PWR
  - Connect chip signals to FMC. Pin planning: want roughly equal delays on all serialtl nets.
- [ ] Add debug headers [d:6/10]
- [ ] Add UART headers + jumpers
- [ ] Add JTAG headers
- [ ] Add clock nets with impedance control
- [ ] Add clock probe pads
- [ ] Redo check of FMC symbol (pin name to pin coordinate mapping)
- [ ] Add GND/VADJ drivers for unused FMC nets
  - Just to make sure FPGA can read things off the FMC connector
